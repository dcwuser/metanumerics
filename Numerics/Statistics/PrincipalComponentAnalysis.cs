    /// It attempts to identify a small number of factors which account for most of the variation in the data.</para>

    /// basis vectors, called the principal components, are ordered by the total variance explained by each.</para>
    /// <para>Suppose, for example, you measure the value of different possessions possessions for a sample of people:
    /// home value, car value, furniture value, etc. You might expect that much of the variation in these numbers can
    /// be explained by one underlying factor, which you might call "wealth". If this is true, then a PCA analysis will
    /// show that the most principal component explains a very large faction of the total variance, and the other less
    /// principal components will explain only small fractions of the total variance.</para>
